    <p>
    I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering at FIT CTU in Prague. 
    I previously earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Graphics at the same faculty. 
    Outside of school, I enjoy working on multiple projects at once. At the moment, my time is divided between:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Junior Software Developer at <a href="https://ynput.io" target="_blank">Ynput</a> – contributing to the AYON studio platform. 
            My main focus is pipeline development using <i>Python, C++, OpenUSD</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tiny House Project (<a href="https://naslajfu.cz" target="_blank">naslajfu.cz</a>) – responsible for guest management, client communication, 
            marketing, and social media. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Graphic Designer for <a href="https://handballuvaly.cz" target="_blank">Handball Úvaly</a> – creating templates for social media infographics, print designs, banners, and more. 
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Sports</b> – in my free time, I play handball, volleyball, and football, sometimes also coaching. 
            I am also a big fan of Slavia Prague. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Ideas</h2>
    <p>
    I have a few project ideas I would like to start working on:
    </p>
    
    <h3>App for Physiotherapists and Trainers</h3>
    <p>
    This idea originated during a conversation with my physiotherapist. 
    The goal is to easily demonstrate how muscles work during different types of movement. 
    Currently, there are many animations available, but nothing interactive AFAIK.
    </p>
    <p><b>In short:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop a 3D "viewer" application.</li>
        <li>Allow users to interactively move parts of the human body.</li>
        <li>Visualize muscle activity using a gradient from green (maximum extension) to red (maximum tension).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Infographics Generator for Sports Clubs</h3>
    <p>
    This project idea comes from the poor visual presentation of many sports clubs on social media, especially in handball. 
    The goal is to provide a user-friendly tool, possibly as a <i>Canva plug-in</i>, since most admins already use it.
    </p>
    <p><b>In short:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Connect variable content (scores, team logos, text fields) via league APIs or similar data sources.</li>
        <li>Offer predefined, professional-looking templates that can be easily customized.</li>
    </ul>
