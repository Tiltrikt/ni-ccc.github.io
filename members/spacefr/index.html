    <h1>František Špaček</h1>
    <!-- <p class="tagline">I like making things work</p> -->
    <p>I studied informatics in high-school, the did bachelor's on FIT. Now I'm in the second year of my master's degree. The specialization for both degrees was web engineering.</p>
    <p>I have some experience with game development in free time and for school assignments. Despite doing web development, the graphical side is unfortunately not one of my strengths.</p>

    <h2>Project idea</h2>
    <p>The goal would be to do music synthesis from Conway's Game of life (or other cellular automata).</p>

    <p>The simulation would run on a fixed sized board. The tiles would be mapped to tones. For example, the tone would be higher when the tile is closer to the top.</p>
    <p>It could have a predictable melody when the life consists of oscilators or gliders, but it could also end up as chaos.</p>
    <p>There are similar projects, but they tend to only synthesize from a small portion of the board, like a single line. This project would use everything.</p>
